the fair community. For more information, please read the following guidelines:

## GENERAL GUIDLINES

1. All entries will be accepted on Monday, August 5, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Entries

products, nor are paid for teaching their skills.
1. A completed entry form must accompany all items to be displayed - one for each
department. Each item should be listed, with no more than one item entered for an
exhibitor in a class. A receipt will be given for each item.
1. Items will be judged according to the Danish System: ranked by points as excellent,
good, or fair, and awarded ribbons for merit. Perfect scores will receive a $5.00
premium. Our generous sponsors provide us with special prizes, which are listed in each
department. The Awards Ceremony will be held Saturday at 5:00 p.m. in the Home and
Garden Building. Winners will be notified and are encouraged to attend.
1. Items are entered for display at your own risk. Our building is locked overnight and security
is provided but not guaranteed.

### AMATEUR FOLK ART — 
Folk Art is not judged on artistic skill, but on the piece’s
ability to express a feeling or evoke an image of a person’s culture or heritage. Folk
Art can be in any medium and is often made of found or reused materials. Folk
Artists often use or construct materials in new and nontraditional ways. Although
some pieces are designed as art and evoke a feeling for the surroundings and/or
culture, many pieces also serve a utilitarian function.

Entrants in the Folk Art category may include a paragraph about their work. It may
include what inspired the piece, their choice of materials, and/or what they are
hoping to convey.
A. Painted Surfaces
B. Other Constructions

### AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHY — Black and White or Color in all classes. One entry
